# ProcrastinationList
Probably the worst "to-do list" you will ever see in your life.

It has some pesky bugs, namely not being able to use "," in task titles/descriptions, and probably a dozen more I haven't found because I don't want to break whatever I have done.

This project was suggested as an LLM as my first one because I was bored.

## How to use it

Seriously, don't.

But if you insist: the program, when initialized, will give you a short guide on the available commands, which you can access by using the `h(elp)` command.

And that's it I guess. Don't except anything nice I guess.
